Alternatively, use Streamlit secrets:
```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **Memory Issues**: Reduce dataset size for large customer counts
3. **Model Training**: ML models may take time to train
4. **Visualization**: Plotly charts may take time to render

### Performance Tips
- Use smaller datasets for development (500-1000 customers)
- Generate new datasets sparingly
- Close unused browser tabs to free memory
- Use Streamlit's caching for expensive operations
